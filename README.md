# MNSIT Deep Neural Network with Model Implementation

From the popular MNSIT data set, I created a Convolutional Neural Netowork with the final model having roughly 99.3% validation accuracy and 99.14% testing accuracy. I also compared how well a basic neural network model performs compared to Convolutional Neural Networks by creating different models and analyzing their results. 
I have used Pygame to implement a way for user to draw their number and the model has been implemented to recognize the user input and predict the number. 

# Requirements 
Python 3.9 or below

Pygame

Tensorflow

Numpy (only if you want to view the dataset images)

Matplotlib (only if you want to view the dataset images)

# Additional Notes
The 28x28 from user input isnt exactly like the training data set so i suggest trying to play around with your handwriting, size, etc and find one that the model recognizes best.

# Google Colab Notebook of Model
A neater way to view my model compared to the py file
